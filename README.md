## Exapunks EXA compiler

This repo has a little s-expression to EXA compiler as well as a few solutions to some Exapunks puzzles.
The compiler is written mostly in the structure of code examples in Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs,
which I'm currently trying to digest.

The compiler isn't super useful since you can't paste code into Exapunks without doing clipboard-to-keystroke hacks.
It's mostly here as a curiosity.
